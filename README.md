## Pushing to GitHub

Before deploying, you'll need to push your code to GitHub:

```bash
# If you haven't initialized git yet:
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git

# Stage and commit all files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Sunny Discord Bot"

# Push to GitHub
# You'll need to authenticate with GitHub
# Option 1: Use GitHub CLI (recommended)
gh auth login
git push -u origin master

# Option 2: Use Personal Access Token
# Create a token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Then use it as your password when prompted
git push -u origin master
```

**Important:** Make sure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file (it should be by default) to keep your tokens secure!

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Render.com (Recommended - Easy Setup)

Free tier with 750 hours/month. **Important:** Free web services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity and wake up on the next request.

#### Quick Deploy:

1. **Push code to GitHub** (see instructions below)
2. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
3. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - **Name:** sunny-bot
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build Command:** `npm install`
   - **Start Command:** `npm start`
6. Add environment variables:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN` (from Discord Developer Portal)
   - `DISCORD_OWNER_ID` (your Discord user ID)
   - `DISCORD_SERVER_ID` (your server ID)
   - `CLAUDE_API_KEY` (from Anthropic Console)
   - `MODERATION_LEVEL` = `2`
7. Click "Create Web Service"

The bot includes a health check endpoint at `/health` to keep it alive on Render's free tier.

**Note:** The free tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity, which may cause brief delays in bot responses. For 24/7 uptime, upgrade to a paid plan ($7/month).

### Option 2: Fly.io

Free tier includes 3 shared VMs with 256MB RAM each.

```bash
# Install Fly CLI
# Windows: https://fly.io/docs/hands-on/install-flyctl/

# Login
fly auth login

# Launch app (follow prompts)
fly launch

# Set secrets
fly secrets set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
fly secrets set DISCORD_OWNER_ID=your_id_here
fly secrets set CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_key_here

fly deploy

# View logs
fly logs
```

### Option 3: Railway.app

Free tier includes 500 hours/month.

1. Connect GitHub repo to Railway
2. Add environment variables in dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push

### Option 4: VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)

```bash
# SSH into server
ssh user@your-server

# Install Node.js, clone repo, configure
# Use PM2 for process management
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start src/index.js --name sunny-bot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot won't start

**"Invalid token" error:**
- Verify `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` is correct
- Regenerate token in Discord Developer Portal if needed

**"Missing intents" error:**
- Enable Message Content Intent in Developer Portal ‚Üí Bot ‚Üí Privileged Gateway Intents

**"Cannot find module" errors:**
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies

### Bot doesn't respond

**Check these:**
1. Bot has "Administrator" permission or at minimum "Read Messages", "Send Messages", "Manage Roles"
2. Message Content Intent is enabled in Developer Portal
3. You're using correct trigger phrases: "Hey Sunny", @mention, or replying to Sunny's messages
4. Check logs in `logs/combined.log` for errors

### Commands don't work

**Owner commands fail:**
- Verify `DISCORD_OWNER_ID` in `.env` matches your Discord User ID exactly
- Make sure you're using natural language: "Hey Sunny, create a channel called music" not "/create channel"

**Role assignment fails:**
- Ensure roles exist in Discord server with exact names from config
- Sunny's role must be higher than roles she's assigning
- Check Sunny has "Manage Roles" permission

## AI Model Information

### Multi-Provider Architecture

Sunny now supports **intelligent model selection** with cost optimization:

**Z.AI GLM (Recommended for Cost Savings):**
- **Smart Selection**: Automatically picks between GLM-4.5-Air (efficient) and GLM-4.6 (advanced) based on message complexity
- **GLM-4.5-Air**: 81% cost savings, 90.6% tool-calling success rate, 217.5 tokens/sec
- **GLM-4.6**: Latest model for complex reasoning and advanced tasks
- **Cost**: $0.20-0.60/1M input, $1.10-2.20/1M output
- **Best For**: Production Discord bots with high message volume

**Anthropic Claude:**
- **Claude 3 Haiku**: 73% cost savings, reliable and proven
- **Claude 3.5 Haiku**: Current generation, excellent balance
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Most advanced agentic workflows (not required for typical usage)
- **Cost**: $0.25-3.00/1M input, $1.25-15.00/1M output
- **Best For**: Maximum reliability and official support

**Model Selection Logic (Z.AI):**
```javascript
// Simple messages ‚Üí GLM-4.5-Air (fast, cheap)
"Hey Sunny, how are you?"

// Complex operations ‚Üí GLM-4.6 (advanced)
"Create a new channel, set permissions, and announce it in #general"
```

**Change Models:**
```env
# Z.AI with smart selection (recommended)
AI_PROVIDER=zai
ZAI_MODEL=glm-4.5-air  # Default for simple tasks

# Claude Haiku (stable)
AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-haiku-20240307
```

## Cost Information

**Discord Bot:** Free

**AI Provider Costs (Pay-as-you-go):**
