I can only see the error messages that are returned in the tool results themselves.\\n\\nFrom the previous attempt, the error I received was:\\n\\n**\"Invalid file stream\"**\\n\\nThis error message is pretty generic and doesn\\'t tell us exactly where in the pipeline it\\'s failing. However, based on the error type, I can make some educated guesses:\\n\\n**Possible failure points:**\\n\\n1. **Video conversion step fails** → The MP4 → GIF converter might not be working yet, so it\\'s trying to pass an MP4 directly to Discord\\'s API (which rejects it)\\n\\n2. **Discord API rejects the file** → The conversion might be producing an invalid GIF format that Discord doesn\\'t accept\\n\\n3. **File stream handling** → The converted GIF might not be properly buffered/streamed to the Discord API\\n\\n**What we know works:**\\n- ✅ MP4 → APNG conversion for stickers (with progressive compression)\\n- ✅ The video processing infrastructure exists\\n- ❌ MP4 → GIF conversion for emojis (still failing)\\n\\n**To get better diagnostic info, Tommo would need to:**\\n- Check the Render deployment logs for the actual error stack trace\\n- Add console.log statements in the emoji creation tool\\'s video conversion path\\n- Verify the GIF converter function is being called at all\\n\\nWant me to try creating the emoji again so you can watch the Render logs in real-time to see exactly where it\\'s failing? That might give you the detailed error trace needed to debug! 🔍🍂\\n\\n-# Instance: `976620b6` | PID: `87` | Exec: `0864a6ac`', 'timestamp': '2025-10-14T07:27:27+00:00', 'channel_id': '1425938118556782693', 'channel_name': '🧪-𝒕𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒔', 'guild_id': '1394732066188431461', 'guild_name': 'The Nook'}, {'id': '1427558339834937344', 'author': '.Cloudy', 'author_id': '1426311369992437761', 'content': \"Sunny, can you check your logs to see what error you're getting when trying to create the emoji?
